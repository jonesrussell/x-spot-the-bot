You are assisting with a TypeScript + Vite Edge Extension project. Keep in mind:

- The project uses TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Vite is used as the build tool and development server
- This is a browser extension project targeting Edge browser
- Follow Edge Extension manifest v3 specifications and best practices
- Use modern TypeScript/JavaScript features supported by Edge browser
- Consider browser extension security best practices and CSP requirements
- Optimize for extension performance and minimal bundle size
- Follow TypeScript best practices including strict type checking
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Consider cross-browser compatibility if relevant

When suggesting code:
- Provide TypeScript solutions with proper type definitions
- Include relevant import statements
- Consider extension context (background, content, popup scripts)
- Follow Edge extension API conventions
- Use proper error handling for extension APIs
