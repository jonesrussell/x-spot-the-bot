Project: X Spot The Bot Edge Extension
Description: Browser extension to identify potential bot accounts in X (Twitter) notifications.

Tech Stack:
- TypeScript ~5.5.3
- Node.js v22.12.0
- ESM modules (es2022)

Code Standards:
1. TypeScript:
   - All source files in .ts
   - Type-only imports for interfaces
   - Private class fields (#)
   - Const objects over enums
   - ESM imports with .js extensions

2. Type Safety:
   - Runtime type narrowing
   - Discriminated unions
   - Const assertions
   - Type safety for DOM, Chrome API, async ops

3. UI:
   - Bot indicators: ü§ñ (>=60%), ‚ö†Ô∏è (30-59%), ‚úì (<30%)
   - Dark theme matching X's UI
   - High contrast + accessibility
   - !important CSS rules

4. Logging:
   - Prefixes: [XBot:Core/DOM/Analyzer/UI]
   - Include relevant data
   - Debug level for verbose

Code Organization:
1. Single Responsibility:
   - Each class/module has one primary purpose
   - Services split by domain (UI/DOM/Analysis)
   - Clear separation between core logic and UI

2. DRY Principles:
   - Shared utilities in common modules
   - Reusable test fixtures and helpers
   - Common types and interfaces

3. Separation of Concerns:
   - DOM operations isolated from analysis
   - UI logic separate from data processing
   - Storage separate from business logic

Bot Detection:
- High probability: >= 0.6
- Patterns:
  * Random alphanumeric (0.3): ^[a-z0-9]{8,}$
  * Many numbers (0.2): [0-9]{4,}
  * Bot keywords (0.3): bot|spam|[0-9]+[a-z]+[0-9]+
  * Random/numeric suffix (0.2): [a-z]+[0-9]{4,}$

Testing:
1. Organization:
   - Unit tests in __tests__ directories
   - Shared test fixtures in test/fixtures
   - Mock implementations in __mocks__
   - Integration tests separate from units

2. Best Practices:
   - Test files mirror source structure
   - One describe block per class/function
   - Clear test descriptions
   - Isolated test cases

3. Coverage Requirements:
   - 80% minimum coverage
   - All services must be tested
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Test edge cases

Build:
- Vite + ESM
- manifest_version: 3
- content.js output
- Tree shaking enabled
